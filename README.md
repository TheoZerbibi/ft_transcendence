### NestJS

NestJS is an open-source JavaScript framework for back-end development. It is built on the Node.js platform and heavily inspired by the Angular front-end framework.

NestJS promotes the use of modular concepts and offers a robust architecture for building scalable applications.

NestJS is useful for:

- **Modular Structure**: NestJs encourages a modular organization of the code, making it easier to manage the different parts of the application.
- **TypeScript**: allows the use of TypeScript for development, offering benefits such as static type checking and better code maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection**: uses the principle of dependency injection to make the code more modular, testable, and extensible.
- **HTTP Support**: facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs or HTTP services with a system for managing routes and controllers.
- **WebSockets**: offers native support for websockets for real-time applications.
- **Middleware**: offers a middleware system for processing HTTP requests at different levels.
- **Integrated ORM**: integrates tools like TypeORM to simplify the management of relational databases.
- **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**: adopts some principles of aspect-oriented programming, allowing for better separation of concerns.
- **Extensibility**: allows the use of third-party libraries and offers flexibility for integrating other libraries and tools.

NestJS has a 3-layer architecture consisting of controllers, providers, and modules, enabling developers to create clean, non-overlapping code.

### Sockets with NestJs and Sockets.io

Sockets (WebSockets) are a technology for bi-directional real-time communication between the client and the server. In the context of NestJS, Socket.io is a library that facilitates the implementation of WebSockets.

Utility:

- **Bidirectional Communication**: allows real-time data exchange between the client and the server in a bidirectional manner.
- **Real-time Applications**: ideal for applications requiring instant updates, such as chat and real-time gaming applications.
- **Data Pushing**: enables the server to send data to clients without them having to explicitly request it.
- **Notifications**: facilitates the implementation of real-time notifications for users.
- **Collaboration**: useful for applications that require real-time collaboration between multiple users.
- **Responsiveness**: offers increased responsiveness compared to traditional communication methods based on HTTP.
Integration with NestJS:
- **WebSocket Module**: NestJS offers a WebSocket module that simplifies the integration of WebSockets into the application.
- **@WebSocketGateway**: is a decorator used to define a WebSocket gateway that handles communication with clients.
- **@WebSocketServer**: allows injecting the WebSocket server instance into the application's components.
- **Connection Management**: allows managing connections, disconnections, and data exchanges between the server and clients.

#### Example of Use

In a real-time chat, the server can use sockets to instantly send messages to connected clients without them having to refresh the page.

Advantages of Socket.io:

- **Compatibility**: works across different browsers and platforms.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: automatically manages reconnection attempts in case of connection loss.

Limitations:

- **Firewall**: some firewalls and proxies may interfere with WebSocket connections.

### Redis

Communication between sockets (via Sockets.io) and the back-end, using a Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) system, can be implemented to enable efficient real-time communication.

**The Pub/Sub model is a messaging model where components of a system communicate without being directly coupled.** In this model, there are entities called 'publishers' that emit messages (publications) and entities called 'subscribers' that receive these messages (subscriptions).

#### Integration with the Back-end

- **Publisher**: The back-end can be configured as a message publisher in a Pub/Sub system. When an important event occurs (e.g., the reception of a new message in a chat application), the back-end publishes a message associated with that event. In the context of NestJS, it is possible to use custom events or specific mechanisms from Socket.io to publish messages.
- **Subscription**: The back-end can also subscribe to specific channels or events from other parts of the system. When an

 event to which the back-end is subscribed occurs (e.g., a chat message received from another part of the system), the back-end can react accordingly.

#### Integration with Sockets

- **Subscriber**: Client-side sockets can be configured as subscribers to these specific channels or events. When a message is published by the back-end, sockets that are subscribed to that particular channel will automatically receive that message.
- **Emitter**: Sockets can also act as emitters, publishing messages to the back-end to signal client-side events.

#### Example of Use

Imagine a real-time chat application:

When a user sends a new message, the back-end publishes a "new message" event. Client-side sockets that are subscribed to this event will automatically receive the message and be able to display it in real-time.

Advantages:

- This model promotes compartmentalization of components, improving the scalability and flexibility of the system.
- It allows asynchronous and real-time communication between different parts of the application.

Limitations:

- Implementing this model requires good management of channels, events, and messages to avoid performance and security issues.
