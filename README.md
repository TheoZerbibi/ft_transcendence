<h1>FT_TRANSCENDENCE</h1>

## üèì Project Presentation

ft_transcendence is the final project of the Common Core at √âcole 42.

The goal of this project is to consolidate the knowledge acquired throughout the curriculum to develop a web application, accessible from a modern web browser.

This application takes the form of a responsive Pong game, accessible only to students of √âcole 42 via Oauth2 connection, and includes a user database.

## üé® Artistic Direction

For this project, we decided to draw inspiration from the game Omori.

Omori is a role-playing game (RPG) developed by the independent studio Omocat. Based on the webcomic series Omori by the director (Omocat), the game was released in December 2020. Featuring explicit themes such as anxiety and depression, the game contains elements of psychological horror.

This project thus pays homage to this work by adopting its graphic style and atmosphere. As a student project, it is not intended for commercialization. No profit will be made from this project. All copyrights are reserved to the Omocat studio.
